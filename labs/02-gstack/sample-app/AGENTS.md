# Agent context for the gstack sample app

This is lab 02 (gstack adaptation). The lab README is at `../README.md`.

## gstack rules

- At session start, read `.gstack/AGENTS.md` as the local gstack skill index and
  workflow guide.
- Treat `.gstack/<name>/SKILL.md` files as the authoritative spec for each
  slash command. When I say "act as the CEO/Founder" or `/plan-ceo-review`, load
  the matching SKILL.md first without waiting for another prompt.
- Run gstack roles in this order for this lab:
  /office-hours → /plan-ceo-review → /plan-eng-review → /autoplan
  → implement → /review → /qa → /retro
- Save design output to DESIGN.md, plan output to PLAN.md, retrospective to
  RETRO.md.

## Implementation rules

- Only Python standard library and static HTML/CSS/JS.
- Static site lives under `web/`. Tests live under `tests/`.
- Run tests with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`.
- Run the site with `python3 -m http.server 5173 --directory web`.
